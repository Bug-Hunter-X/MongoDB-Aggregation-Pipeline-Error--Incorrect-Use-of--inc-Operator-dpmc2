# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug: Incorrect $inc Usage

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `$inc` operator within a MongoDB aggregation pipeline. The issue arises from incorrectly utilizing the `$inc` operator within the `$group` stage, leading to unexpected results.

## Bug Description

The provided code snippet attempts to increment a field using `$inc` within the `$group` stage of an aggregation pipeline. However, `$inc` is not intended for use within `$group` for creating sums; it's meant for updating documents. This leads to the pipeline failing to produce correct sum values.

## Bug Solution

The solution involves replacing the `$inc` usage with the correct aggregation operator, `$sum`, within the `$group` stage. This ensures that the pipeline correctly calculates the sum of the specified field.
